# Shape Coded Particles (SCP)
This repository holds the code, experiments, and examples of how to work with SCP.  

## Semantic Segmentation with SCP  
particle_segmentation.ipynb is a Notebook showcasing an example for training different models for multiclass segmentation.  
The corresponding datasets can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IdNliHuYhy35FoiNLBzOWP3JlsupTaol/view?usp=share_link).  

## Augmentation by Translocation (ABT)
A simple implementation of the ABT algorithm can be found in the ABT folder.  
The example is written for the 10S_raw_abt dataset.  
Which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IdNliHuYhy35FoiNLBzOWP3JlsupTaol/view?usp=share_link).
